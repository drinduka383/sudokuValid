# sudokuValid

## Description

This is a Sudoku Validator made in python. It takes the information from a selective sudoku grid which was given as a CSV file, and runs a few functions to check if it is a valid row/column/sub-grid.

A sudoku grid consists of 9×9 = 81 cells split in 9 sub-grids of 3×3 = 9 cells.
For the grid to be correct, each row must contain one occurrence of each digit (1 to 9), each column must contain one occurrence of each digit (1 to 9) and each sub-grid must contain one occurrence of each digit (1 to 9).

To excecute it, simply run the script and type the name of the file you want to validate from the given sets.
